      THIS WEBSITE IS NOT ABOUT YOU, BUT IT IS FOR YOU. THE GOAL IS TO ARRIVE AT WHAT I (AS A 21 YEAR OLD) THINK IS BEAUTIFUL - MOSTLY IRONICALLY, SOMETIMES SERIOUSLY, BUT ALWAYS REAL. WHENEVER I USED TO CREATE AN AVATAR FOR SOME WORLD BUILDING GAME, I WOULD USUALLY STICK TO CONVENTIONS. IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WHAT IS CONVENTIONALLY BEAUTIFUL ISN'T BEAUTIFUL. WHEN I STARTED CREATING THE AVATARS MOVING AWAY THOSE CONVENTIONS, I WAS ABLE TO FIND MY OWN PERSONAL SENSE OF BEAUTIFUL. AND IT'S BASIC AND GARISH. BUT IT'S UNSERIOUS, IT'S FUN. AND WHY WOULD I CREATE SOMETHING THAT I CAN'T LAUGH AT, WHICH IS THE SAME REASON WHY GOD CREATED ME. IT IS INDULGENCE AND IT'S ENJOYABLE, AND THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME (AT 21 YEARS OLD). Ave Maria. Santa María, Madre de Dios, ruega por nosotros, pecadores, ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte. Amén.
