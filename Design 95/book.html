      <br>DESIGN RULES FOR THOSE</br>
      <br>WHO LOOKED AT THE</br>
      <br>PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN </br>
      <br>AND WANTED AN ALTERNATIVE</br></div>
    <div class="hard"></div>
    <div>
      <small>I thought I was exercising my freedom by making this.</small>
    </div>

      <img src= "apple.png" alt="C:\4th Year\Web Dev\Rules Page - book\apple.png"
      <small>Rule 1</small>
      <small> Being ironic is the best design choice you could make – use nonsense and the absurd to your advantage and you will find that at best it makes you giggle, at worst – it makes you sigh. </small>
</div>

      <small> Rule 2 </small>
      <small>
      When you’re going for a black and white theme – avoid making the background black and text white.
      White background.
      Black text.
      Delicious.  </small>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="sparkles.png" alt="C:\4th Year\Web Dev\Rules Page - book\sparkles.png" />
      <small> Rule 3 </small>
      <small> While designing cards or invitations for festive occasions like funerals and birthdays, the text should always be cursive. </small>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="fam.jpg" alt="C:\4th Year\Web Dev\Rules Page - book\fam.jpg" />
      <small> Rule 4 </small>
      <small> When you’re downloading an image that has a watermark – don’t plastic surgery away its birthmarks, that’s really rude. </small>
    </div>
    <div>
      <img src="spiderman.png" alt="C:\4th Year\Web Dev\Rules Page - book\spiderman.png" />
      <small> Rule 5 </small>
      <small> Everything you design must have a face on it and it should never be your own.</small>
    </div>
    <div> <small> Rule 6 </small>
    <br> Always start </br>
    <br>with asymmetry, when that </br>
    <br>just does not work – then </br>
    <br>make things symmetrical. </br>
    <br> But don’t just start</br>
    <br> directly with </br>
    <br>symmetry because you think</br>
    <br> no one’s watching.</br>
     I will be watching.

      <small> Rule 7 </small>
      <small> Browns and beiges are prohibited. That’s right – even at gunpoint. </small>
